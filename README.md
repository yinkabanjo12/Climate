# Climate

A simple app to help you find out the weather for the day in any given city. Simply type in the city of your choice and you will be
given a description of the weather in your chosen city and the temrperature in degrees celcius. This was achieved using REST API calls
to the OpenWeather API. Data visualisation of how the temperature changes across the day was also achieved using a Graph API. 

Please find below a link to an unlisted YouTube video demonstrating the functionality within the Android App.
